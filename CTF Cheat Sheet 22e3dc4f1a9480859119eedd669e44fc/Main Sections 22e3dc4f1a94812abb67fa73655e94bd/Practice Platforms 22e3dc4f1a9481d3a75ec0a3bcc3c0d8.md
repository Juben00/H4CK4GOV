# Practice Platforms

## General Info & Guidance

### 💡 **What is a Practice Platform?**

> CTF practice platforms offer challenges designed to simulate real-world cybersecurity problems. They’re great for improving problem-solving, learning tools, and understanding vulnerabilities.
> 

### 🧩 **Types of Platforms**

- 🧠 **Jeopardy-Style CTFs** – Category-based (e.g., Web, Crypto, etc.), score-based.
- 🔐 **Realistic Labs** – Simulate actual systems (e.g., TryHackMe, Hack The Box).
- 🕹️ **WarGames** – Linear learning games, often in terminal (e.g., OverTheWire).
- 🎮 **Self-Hosted VMs** – Downloadable or local environments to practice offline.
